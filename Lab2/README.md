Problem Type: Regression

Target Variable: The median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

Goal: The model is expected to learn the relationship between various features (like number of rooms, crime rate, tax) and the house price to predict values for new houses.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston. This is a Supervised Learning problem, specifically a Regression task, because the target variable (Price) is continuous. The model will be trained on historical data containing features such as the average number of rooms per dwelling, crime rate per capita, and property tax rates to understand how these factors influence real estate values.
