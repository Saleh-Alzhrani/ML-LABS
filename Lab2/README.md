Problem Type: Regression

Target Variable: Sales Amount

Input Features:
Boxes Shipped: (Numerical).
Product: (Categorical).
Country: (Categorical).

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the total Sales Amount for coffee products based on transaction details. This is a Regression problem because the target variable is a continuous numerical value representing revenue.

 The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical sales records, including the number of boxes shipped, the type of coffee product (e.g., Arabica, Robusta), and the country of sale. By analyzing these features, the model aims to understand how quantity and product type influence the total sales figure.
